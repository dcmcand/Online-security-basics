					<blockquote>
						"By the end of this class, you will feel less secure and be more secure"<br/>
					  - Blake Carver	
						</ blockquote>
						<aside class='notes'>
						<p>Security is not binary. Something is more secure or less secure. It is wrong to say something is or is not secure.</p>
						</aside></section>
				<section>
					1. Do Your Updates
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Most hacks involve known vulnerabilities</p>
						<p>Equifax hack used vulnerability that was patched months ago</p>
						<p>Auto updates ensure that updates get applied</p>
						<p>Software makers generally do well patching security vulnerabilities, but if you don't update, it doesn't matter</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					2. If you can remember all of your passwords, you are doing it wrong
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>LassPass estimates that 85% of account compromises are because of poor passwords</p>
						<p>Every account should have strong, unique password</p>
						<p>Credential stuffing attacks use compromised credentials on all popular websites</p>
						<p>Password Managers are the best way to deal with this
							<p><a href='https://www.lastpass.com/' target='_blank'>LastPass</a></p>
							<p><a href='https://bitwarden.com/' target='_blank'>Bitwarden</a></p>
							<p><a href='https://keepass.info/' target='_blank'>KeePass</a></p>
							<p><a href='https://1password.com/' target='_blank'>1Password</a></p>
							</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					3. A Long Password is a Strong Password
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Adding length to a password makes it much harder to guess than adding complexity</p>
						<p>Passphrases are better than passwords</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					4. Don't rely on passwords
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Two Factor Authentication (2FA) uses something you know (your password) and something you have (a cell phone normally) or something you are (biometrics)</p>
						<p>2FA should be used everywhere possible, especially on email</p>
						<p>Keep backup codes safe in case your phone is lost or stolen</p>
						<p>Avoid SMS 2FA if possible (sometimes it isn't possible). SMS 2FA is better than nothing but worse than everything else</p>
					</aside>

			    5. If you don't back it up, you don't care about it	
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>3,2,1 Rpe
							<p>3 Copies of data</p>
							<p>2 different media types</p>
							<p>1 copy off site</p>
							</p>
							<p>Time machine/shadow copy can be used for local backup, but aren't full backup solutions by themselves</p>
							<p>Backblaze, Carbonite, and other online solutions can be very good for offsite backups</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					6. Backups are worthless, restores are priceless	
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>2017 Gitlab lost hours of customer data because none of their 5 backup strategies worked</p>

					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					7. Send letters, not postcards	
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>End to end encryption is the only way to prevent snooping on your traffic</p>
						<p>Https provides E2E encryption for web traffic</p>
						<p>iMessage, WhatsApp, and Signal all provide E2E encryption for messaging</p>
						<p>PGP can protect email, but it is harder to setup. Use signal if you need secure messaging</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					8. Practice defensive browsing
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
						Use privacy enhancing browser plugins
						<ul>uBlock Origin</ul>
						<ul>Https Everywhere</ul>
						<ul>Privacy Badger</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
						Use privacy enhancing settings
						<ul>Use DDG for search</ul>
						<ul>Use Firefox's tracking protection</ul>
						</p>

					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					9. Don't trust public wifi
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Open wifi provides no protection. Your traffic is literally being sent through the air where anyone can see it. Https protections still help though.</p>
						<p>Secured wifi provides limited protections</p>
						<p>WPA3 is coming and will vastly improve things</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					10. Don't trust email
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Email does not have encryption by default</p>
						<p>Email addresses are easy to spoof</p>
						<p>Email accounts are often compromised by poor passwords</p>
						<p>Do not open attachments unless you know what it is and were expecting it</p>
						<p>Do not click links, instead go directly to the address in your web browser</p>
