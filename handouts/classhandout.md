## 1. Do your updates
Do your updates! As software companies learn about vulnerabilities, they send out fixes. By not doing updates, you are making an attackers job easy by letting them use known exploits against you. Any software that is on your computer needs to be kept up to date. For example:
* Your operating system.
  * For windows, use windows update. You can go to <http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-update for more information>
  * For a Mac, you can access updates through the app store. For more information go to <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541>
* Java - <https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml>
* Flash - <https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html>
* Antivirus - If your antivirus isn't up to date, it can't find all of the viruses out there.
* Web browsers - These directly interact with the internet and must be kept up to date.

This isn't a complete list by any means. Every piece of software on your computer needs to be kept up to date or it may turn into an exploitable vulnerability. By using a applications auto-update features, you get the protection without the effort.
## 2. If you can remember all of your passwords, you are doing it wrong
Passwords are absolutely essential to good computer security.  Using weak passwords and reusing passwords are some of the most common mistakes that people make.  Unfortunately, these mistakes make any potential breach, such as hacking someone's email, much more serious.  If you reuse passwords then getting your password for one thing often means they have your password for a lot of other things too. Hackers will use what is known as a credential stuffing attack to increase the impact of a breach. This means they will take compromised credentials and try them on a lot of websites automatically to see if they work other places. This means, if a website does have a breach you need to change the password on any other accounts that use the same password. It is far better to just not reuse passwords.

The best way to do this is to use a password manager. These programs will securely store your passwords for you. This means you only have one password to remember, the master password for your password manager. All the other passwords, you can forget about. This allows you to make them all very strong and unique without having to worry. Most password managers will also generate secure passwords for you. Some good ones are:
* LastPass - <https://www.lastpass.com>
* KeePass - <https://keepass.info>
* 1Password - <https://1password.com>
* Bitwarden - <https://bitwarden.com>

All of these password managers have a free level that you can try to get started. Even their premium levels are very affordable.

## 3. A Long Password is a Strong Password 
The most important thing you can do to make a good password is make it long. As password length increases its strength goes up exponentially. If you simply increase the complexity, strength only increases linearly. 

So if your password is **kdiosn** there are 26^6 or 308,915,776 possibilities. 

If you increase the complexity by adding upper and lower case letters so your password is **KdIOsn** there are 52^6 or 19,770,609,664 possibilities.

On the other hand if you double the length instead of the complexity, and make the password **kdiosnplanew** then there are 26^12 or 94,289,566,600,000,000 possibilities. That is 4,826,809 times stronger.

This assumes a random password that is not subject to a dictionary attack. A dictionary attack is where attackers have huge lists of commonly used passwords. Use your password manager to generate random passwords that are 16 digits long (or longer) and you will be very secure from someone guessing your password.

For your master password, this unfortunately won't work. There are two methods to deal with this.

1. Use the first letter of every word in a phrase. For example, "To be or not to be that is the question" becomes **tbontbtitq**. It is hard to get a really long password like this, and it could possibly be subject to a dictionary attack if you use a very common phrase, but it is decently strong and easily remembered.
2. Use a passphrase. This takes a string of four or five **unrelated** words to make a passphrase. A classic example is [Correct Horse Battery Staple](https://www.xkcd.com/936/). For added complexity, you can change the seperator to something other than a space (yes spaces are valid to use in a password) i.e. Correct%Horse%Battery%Staple, change or alternate the case **CORRECT%horse%BATTERY%staple** or add padding digits at the beginning and end **26CORRECT%horse%BATTERY%staple52**. The key is that we are good at remembering strings of words, but they are still difficult for computers to brute force. As long as you are actually using random words, this is a very secure method.

Remember, if you are using a password generator, you should only need to remember one password.
 
## 4. Don't rely on passwords

##  5. If you don't back it up, you don't care about it

## 6. Backups are worthless, restores are priceless

## 7. Send letters, not postcards

## 8. Practice defensive browsing

## 9. Don't trust public wifi

## 10. Don't trust email
