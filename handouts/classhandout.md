## 1. Do your updates
Do your updates! As software companies learn about vulnerabilities, they send out fixes. By not doing updates, you are making an attackers job easy by letting them use known exploits against you. Any software that is on your computer needs to be kept up to date. For example:
* Your operating system.
  * For windows, use windows update. You can go to http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-update for more information.
  * For a Mac, you can access updates through the app store. For more information go to https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541
* Java - https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml
* Flash - https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html
* Antivirus - If your antivirus isn't up to date, it can't find all of the viruses out there.
* Web browsers - These directly interact with the internet and must be kept up to date.

This isn't a complete list by any means. Every piece of software on your computer needs to be kept up to date or it may turn into an exploitable vulnerability. By using a applications auto-update features, you get the protection without the effort.
## 2. If you can remember all of your passwords, you are doing it wrong
Passwords are absolutely essential to good computer security.  Using weak passwords and reusing passwords are some of the most common mistakes that people make.  Unfortunately, these mistakes make any potential breach, such as hacking someone's email, much more serious.  If you reuse passwords then getting your password for one thing often means they have your password for a lot of other things too. Hackers will use what is known as a credential stuffing attack to increase the impact of a breach. This means they will take compromised credentials and try them on a lot of websites automatically to see if they work other places. This means, if a website does have a breach you need to change the password on any other accounts that use the same password. It is far better to just not reuse passwords.

The best way to do this is to use a password manager. These programs will securely store your passwords for you. This means you only have one password to remember, the master password for your password manager. All the other passwords, you can forget about. This allows you to make them all very strong and unique without having to worry. Most password managers will also generate secure passwords for you. Some good ones are:
* LastPass - https://www.lastpass.com
* KeePass - https://keepass.info
* 1Password - https://1password.com
* Bitwarden - https://bitwarden.com

All of these password managers have a free level that you can try to get started. Even their premium levels are very affordable.
